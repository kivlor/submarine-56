### Submarine 56

Decided my 'project' for [Camp JS](http://campjs.com/) wuold be to learn [Phaser](http://phaser.io). After reading through and completing most Thomas Palaf's Discover Phaser book I set out to create my own game.  
Submarine 56 is a super simple game, you controll Submarin 56 and you goal is to hunt enemy subs.
